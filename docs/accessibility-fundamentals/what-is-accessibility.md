# What is accessibility and why it matters

Accessibility is the practice of making your website usable by as many people as possible.

Accessibility is often thought of as being only related to people with a disability, however, this is not the case. Accessibility goes beyond a permanent impediment; there are temporary disabilities as a result of an injury or medical procedure, or factors such as aging. Aging can progressively affect our eyesight, dexterity via arthritis in the hands, cognitive ability, and more. Accessibility can also include situational factors, such as being outdoors on a mobile device with screen glare, or other issues where lighting effects viewability.

We donâ€™t want to exclude anyone from accessing the content of our websites, especially because of a disability. This narrows our audience and negatively impacts the everyday lives of those who live with disabilities. The same way buildings, sidewalks, and other public infrastructures are built with the ability level of everyone in mind, our websites should provide everyone with the same access to content.
