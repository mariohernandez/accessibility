# Types of disabilities

The point of accessibility is to make content on the web available to every differently abled body. But that calls into question what all falls into this category. Who are we actually doing this for? As mentioned before, many consider the blind a leading example of those we have to take into consideration, and we’ve touched on a few other issues that affect people around the web. But how many people are actually affected by disabilities?

According to the [Centers of Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html), at least 26% of Americans identify as having some form of disability. Sometimes the disability we are dealing with can be easily overlooked. In many such cases, people deal with low vision or bad vision use assistive technologies like glasses to correct these issues. They are such a common place item in our society that we tend to forget that this is an issue.

Other issues can be overlooked because they don’t have a tendency to last. These are known as Temporary Conditions/Disabilities.

## Temporary Conditions/Disabilities

A temporary disability is a short-term medical condition that can result in needing the same attention that individuals with permanent disabilities require. Examples of temporary disabilities may include but are not limited to: broken limbs, hand injuries, or short term impairments following surgery or medical treatments. As an example, somebody who works around a lot of tiny bits of debris might accidentally get something in their eye, damaging their retina. It may take time to heal and as such, they now have to deal with the same issues of low vision that somebody with macular degeneration may suffer with. This same person may even be at a point where they are essentially blind for a short period of time, and now they have to make their way around similar to somebody that is permanently blind.

Unlike these others, this condition won’t last but while the issue persists they have to be able to use the same tools that somebody with a permanent disability uses.

### Screen glare, slow internet connection

While sometimes a nuisance that is difficult to avoid, screen glare can be considered a temporary condition that can hamper website accessibility because the environmental factors that cause screen glare can make it difficult to see.

Just as in suddenly facing some of the same issues of low vision, so too can conditions like screen glare cause you to have difficulties seeing a website. If there are low contrasting colors, for instance, as you are navigating on a screen that has glare, you are more likely to make errors or have frustrations with the website or application.

Making a more accessible web experience should also include addressing the needs of people with slow speed internet connection. Although internet speeds have gotten faster over time, many people may have lower speed connections for a variety of reasons such as their location. In order to address the needs of users that have low speed internet, it is important to take some of the following into consideration:

* Make sure you add alternative text to images, multimedia and other non-text objects. Doing this means people with low bandwidth connections, who may have disabled images and other media, can still understand the meaning of your content.
* Use style sheets to decrease file size and increase download speed. This includes avoiding inline style where possible.
* Cache pages or sections on your site, such as the document footer or navigation, on your site which don't change very often.
* Consider making an alternative lightweight version \(like a mobile site\) that is used for slower bandwidths.

## Permanent Conditions/Disabilities

Permanent conditions are lifelong disabilities. They can encompass any number of issues from vision, auditory, cognitive, motor functionality, and aging. Each of these presents their own hurdles that need to be tackled when it comes to web accessibility.

### Age Conditions

Although age is not a disability, many older users may experience some of the same challenges as people with disabilities as they navigate the web. Some of the challenges may include:

* Vision - As we age, our vision may become worse over time. Some of these abilities may mean issues with color sensitivity, color perception, and near-focus
* Physical dexterity - Fine motor control may change as people age, making it more difficult to use a mouse or trackpad to navigate the web
* Hearing changes - Over time, it may become harder to hear higher pitched sounds or to differentiate between sounds, limiting the access to some types of media such as podcasts without the aid of other tools such as transcripts
* Cognitive changes - Short term memory loss may be common in people as they age, which can make it difficult to complete tasks online. Other common cognitive issues include difficulty concentrating and being easily distracted, which may also hinder the ability to complete tasks.

It is important to understand the needs of various age conditions and create an experience that can work for all users, not just those of specific age groups.

### Vision

Vision impairment can range from mild or moderate vision loss in one or both eyes \(low vision\) to substantial and uncorrectable vision loss in both eyes \(blindness\). Some have reduced or no sensitivity to certain colors \(color blindness\), or increased sensitivity to bright colors. These variations in perception of colors and brightness can be independent of the visual acuity. Some issues affecting those with vision impairment are:

* Images, controls, video, and other elements without alternate text or audio alternatives
* Text, images, and layouts that cannot be resized accurately
* Text and images without sufficient contrast between foreground and background color
* Websites and web browsers that do not provide full keyboard support
* Incorrect use of fonts that may affect people with Dyslexia-like symptoms

### Auditory

Auditory disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or both ears \(hard of hearing\) to substantial and uncorrectable hearing loss in both ears \(deafness\). Some people with auditory disabilities can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech, especially when there is background noise.

Some issues affecting those with auditory disabilities are:

* Audio content without captions or transcripts
* Media players without display captions or without volume controls
* Media players without options to adjust the text size and colors for captions
* Web-based services that rely on interaction using voice only

### Cognitive

Cognitive disabilities involve individuals with difficulty processing information and how it is delivered, whether written, read, or spoken. Specific learning disabilities can affect the ability to focus.

Some individuals learn more slowly or have difficulty understanding complex concepts. Some issues affecting those with cognitive disabilities are:

* Complex navigation mechanisms and page layouts that are difficult to understand and use or cannot be adapted using web browser controls or custom style sheets
* Complex sentences that are difficult to read and unusual words that are difficult to understand
* Long passages of text without images, graphs, or other illustrations to highlight the context
* Moving, blinking, or flickering content
* Background audio that cannot be turned off

### Dyslexia

Over 40 million US adults and 20% of school-aged children have dyslexia, according to [Austin Learning Solutions](https://www.austinlearningsolutions.com/blog/38-dyslexia-facts-and-statistics.html). Dyslexia is considered a learning disorder and the signs of its presence vary by age, but in general someone who has dyslexia may struggle with reading, pronouncing words, or finding the “right” words when they are learning to read.

Viewing content on the web can be a struggle for people with dyslexia, especially as websites have evolved over time to use script fonts that look similar to cursive but may cause problems for people with a learning disorder like dyslexia.

There are many factors to take into consideration to improve digital accessibility for people with dyslexia. In general, some guidelines to follow include:

* Use san serif fonts like Arial, Verdana, and Tahoma that are easier to read
* Use legible font size such as 12 pt. Or 14 pt. font
* Add line spacing to your design—1.5 or double spacing helps—to assist in the reading process
* Break up lengthy paragraphs so they're more digestible for users
* Keep consistent text alignment
* Avoid formatting such as all caps text, italics, or underlining when not needed
