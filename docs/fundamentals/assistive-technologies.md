# Assistive technologies and adaptive strategies

People with disabilities access websites in different ways depending on their individual needs and preferences. Specialized software and hardware that help people perform certain tasks are referred to as “assistive technologies.” “Adaptive strategies” refers to when people configure standard software and hardware according to their needs.

## Examples of assistive technologies
* Screen readers
* Screen magnification software
* Alternative input devices

## Examples of adaptive strategies
* Increasing text size
* Reducing mouse speed
* Turning on captions
_We’ll go into detail about screen readers and keyboard-only navigation when we cover tools later on in the training_.
