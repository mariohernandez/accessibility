## The Legal Landscape
In the United States, [Section 508](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973) of the ADA requires that all federal information that is accessible electronically must be accessible for those with disabilities. This information must be accessible in a variety of ways which are specific to each disability.

Educational institutions typically comply with Section 508, as do more and more businesses in the private sector. The number of website accessibility lawsuits [has increased 177% from 2017 to 2018](https://www.adatitleiii.com/2019/01/number-of-federal-website-accessibility-lawsuits-nearly-triple-exceeding-2250-in-2018/). These lawsuits are typically being put forth by activists seeking to raise awareness of the importance of equal access for all in the digital space.

Notable lawsuits in the past few years include Winn-Dixie and Domino’s. [Winn-Dixie](https://www.forbes.com/sites/legalnewsline/2017/06/13/first-of-its-kind-trial-goes-plaintiffs-way-winn-dixie-must-update-website-for-the-blind/#fe479c71b38a) was judged to have violated the ADA because “the inaccessibility of its website denied the plaintiff the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations that Winn-Dixie offers to its sighted customers.”

In the [Domino’s suit in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/07/dominos-supreme-court.html), the plaintiff was unable to order food on Domino’s website and mobile app despite using a screen reader. The judgement stated that the “inaccessibility of Domino’s website and app impedes access to the goods and services of its physical pizza franchises—which are places of public accommodation.”

Practitioners of accessibility currently use the guidelines put forth by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/), the main international standards organization for the world wide web.

These guidelines are continuously being updated as technology evolves. The latest set of standards is the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#guidelines).

The WCAG standards are broken up into three levels: A, AA, and AAA. The lowest level, A, takes into account the most basic needs such as alternative text for images and labels for form elements. The AA level includes all of the A level standards and adds additional criteria including sufficient color contrast ratios and properly formatted headers. The highest level, AAA, includes all of the previous standards and adds enhancements such as greater color contrast and content that is written to specific reading levels.

The current legal landscape appears to be trending towards considering conformance to the WCAG 2.1 level AA standards as compliant with Section 508 of the ADA. It is important to note that accessibility compliance is a moving target, as standards are frequently updated and successful litigation is pushing accessibility forward.

While we cannot offer legal advice, in general, making a good faith effort to be accessible by striving to make all information and functionality available to all users is the North Star guiding accessibility best practices.

These best practices include:
* Manual testing with assistive technology to gain an understanding of the user experience
* Interpreting the WCAG guidelines to provide all users with all content and functionality, rather than attempting to follow the standards to the letter
* Understanding how to prioritize fixes.
* They can even include an [accessibility statement](https://www.mediacurrent.com/accessibility) on a website and [a way to contact the organization to report issues](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/accessibility-form.html).
