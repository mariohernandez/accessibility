# Introduction

_A hands-on training workshop by_ [_Mediacurrent_](https://mediacurrent.com/).

Accessibility is a critical part of any website. It ensures any person, regardless of their physical abilities, should be able to access, navigate and use a website. Accessibility isn’t new but it’s not surprising if you haven’t heard of it. Public awareness is just now coming into the mainstream. To some people, accessibility is a dirty word because it means that if your website is not in compliance with your regions laws, you or your organization could get into legal troubles. However, accessibility is more than that. Accessibility is a moral obligation for anyone building or maintaining websites.
