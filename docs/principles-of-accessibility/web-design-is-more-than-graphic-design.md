# Web design is more than graphic design

The web, being a dynamic and flexible medium, is not as tightly controlled as say, design software. It is not practical and sometimes not possible to line everything up to perfection on the browser as there are many variables that can potentially change how content is displayed. For example, the device type being used, the Operating System of the device, the device preference settings, and color variances between operating systems or monitor resolutions can affect how content is ultimately displayed.

This is why web design is more than graphic design. The web is fluid and trying to contain it by forcing content or elements into place is not only not recommended but can also affect the User Experience \(UX\). Rather than focusing solely on the visual, instead pay close attention to these 3 areas of web design:

* Write good markup. Good markup is well organized markup. HTML that is written following best practices is, in most cases, accessible by default. In addition, proper markup is also good for SEO. Learn more about the right markup in the Principles of Accessibility as well as the Common Accessibility Mistakes sections.
* Use CSS to enhance the existing structure. CSS should be used to emphasize content to make it more meaningful and more impactful. Some examples of how CSS can improve or make content more impactful may include using the right color contrast, headings colors and/or sizes, as well as making links stand out from body content.
* Handle Interactivity with Javascript. Interactivity should work over the structure and style of the website. JavaScript doesnâ€™t have the same immediate importance for accessibility as HTML, but it can help or hurt accessibility, depending on how it is used. Javascript must work alongside the HTML and CSS elements and not break the semantic meaning of what you are building. More information on proper use of Javascript can be found at the [Mozilla Developers site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript).
