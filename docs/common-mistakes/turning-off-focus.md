# Turning off focus

When a page element receives focus (such a form input), the `:focus` Pseudo class provides an indicator to show where in the page the user currently is. This indicator is also triggered when a user navigates a website using the keyboard.

Disabling or hiding the focus indicator is a constant topic of debate between developers, designers, and stakeholders of a website. Some people find the focus indicator around elements not visually appealing and insist on hiding it. However, the focus indicator plays a big factor in accessibility when users navigate a website using a keyboard or have poor vision and should not be disabled. Unfortunately, this is a debate you are not always going to win. The best we can do is educate people on the importance of :focus and hope they also see its value.
