# Inputs missing labels

Adding labels on form elements are a usability improvement as they provide a way to check boxes or toggle controls by clicking the label text as well as the control field. This is useful as it provides more real estate for a person to interact with a form item that might be relatively small (like on a mobile device), if the label was not used in this way. Labels also describe the purpose of the controls which is very important when using a screen reader or other assistive technology.

On long or verbose forms, labels can also act as a visual reference point on the page.  There have been several design trends in the past few years that have seen the label either be
removed or replaced with placeholder text. While using placeholder text lets a sighted user understand the form, a screen reader won't read the placeholder text. So it is critical that we provide each form item with a label. These can be visually hidden, but should always be present.
