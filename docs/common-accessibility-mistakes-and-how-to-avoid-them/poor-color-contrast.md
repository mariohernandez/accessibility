# Poor color contrast

[According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/basics/ced/fastfacts.htm), roughly 12 million people 40 years of age and older have some form of vision impairment. 1 million are blind, which is what many think of when thinking of vision impairment, but it is actually a small percentage of those with vision challenges.

Some of these issues are genetic, but the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reports that 2,000 US workers every day sustain job-related eye injuries requiring medical treatment.

Color blindness is significant and this relates directly to color contrast.

[1 in 12 males have red-green colorblindness](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/color-vision-deficiency#statistics), but there are other types as well. For instance, blue-yellow color vision affects men and women equally and impacts 1 in 10,000 people worldwide.

## So what is color contrast?

Color contrast is simply the difference between two colors and it comes in many different ways on a website. Text on the background is the most obvious, though there is also text over images, hover colors, and header and footer contrasts.

Put simply, black on white is the highest contrast achievable. It is making the two colors distinct from one another to the greatest amount possible in order to help the most people as possible to be able to absorb your content.

Most brands, however, are not black and white.

Branding may be a challenge, but is not one that can not be overcome. Slight changes in color shade without changing the base color can make a site compliant.

There are several tools available to assess your siteâ€™s compliance with color contrast. With these tools and results, you can see to what extent your site is compliant or not. See our testing and tools section for more details.
