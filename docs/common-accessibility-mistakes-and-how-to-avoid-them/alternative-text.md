# Alternate text in images

As we have said before, web design is about more than the actual design, but the structure of a page. This may leave you wondering what to do to make your images more accessible. A simple solution? Always include the alt attribute.

Use alt attributes as a text alternative in the event someone can’t see the image. Many situations may lead to someone being unable to see an image such as:

* Using a screen reader
* Browser preferences by user to not load images
* Poor or unavailable internet connection
* Image is too large to load

If you fail to include the alt attribute and add helpful text to it, screen readers will read the filename instead. This can be problematic if the filename is not informative and may hinder accessibility.

Although it is more helpful to include text in the alt attribute, there may be instances where the alt attribute can be left empty. For instance, if you have decorative images on the page, you can include the alt attribute but skip adding content to it. Doing this will enable screen readers to exclude the image altogether from announcing it to the user.

Additionally, you may want to leave out alt text if other elements around the image, such as the heading, tell the user what the image is about. Doing this can help you avoid sending the user duplicate content. For instance, if the heading or title includes a person’s name and the alt text is the same name of the person in the photo, then the user experiencing the page with a screen reader may hear the name two times.

Bottom line: always include the alt attribute, but you don’t always need to include text inside of it to describe the image.
