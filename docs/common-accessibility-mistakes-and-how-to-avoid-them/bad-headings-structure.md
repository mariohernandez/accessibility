# Bad headings structure

The headings of a webpage are noted by tags that range from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. and are used to form an outline of the page. Headings can be used to find content quickly and give the user a sense of the topics being covered. However, if done incorrectly, bad headings structure in a page can be a hindrance for accessibility.

When building websites, it might be tempting to use an H1 or H2 to make the text bigger quickly because this formatting already causes text to change in size. However, this might not help organize content like you’d like. For instance, if you use an H1 for a statistic, a screen reader will give the user the content of that header but not the context where it fits.

To use headings structure properly, start with an H1. This is sometimes but not always the page’s main title. Typically there should only be one H1 tag on any given page which indicates the most important piece of content on a page. This is not only good for accessibility, but also benefits SEO.

Like the title tag, an H1 should be informative and give the user an idea of the content that follows. After that topic is covered, you may proceed with an H2 for the next section, and H3s if there are subsections for that H2.

Also, when using headings structure properly, don’t skip the levels in the content. For instance, if you have an H3 in your content, it must be preceded by an H2.

A great example of good headings structure can be found on Wikipedia, where sections are broken out easily and are easy to navigate.
